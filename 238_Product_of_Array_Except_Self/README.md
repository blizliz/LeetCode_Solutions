Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

<strong>Example 1: </strong>

<code>
<strong>Input:</strong>
[1,2,3,4]
 
<strong>Output: </strong>
[24,12,8,6]
</code>
 
<strong>Note:</strong>
Please solve it without division and in O(n).

<strong>Follow up:</strong>
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
